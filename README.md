# Weldork Web

Weldork Web is a full-stack Java web application built with **Spring Boot, Hibernate, and MySQL**.  
It demonstrates a modular backend architecture with database-driven features, integrated with **templated front-end views** using JSP, SCSS, and Bootstrap for styling.  

The project focuses on implementing **user flows, session management, and CRUD operations** with a clean separation of concerns between the persistence layer and the UI.  
It serves as a practical example of building scalable backend systems with professional-grade design patterns, making it a strong foundation for booking systems, newsletters, contact management, or financial tech applications.
